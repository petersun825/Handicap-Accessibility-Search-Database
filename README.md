From the 521 website it states their purpose: "Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 22, ยง 13A, the Architectural Access Board has issued regulations in order to make public buildings and facilities accessible to, functional for, and safe for use by persons with disabilities. These regulations, which are listed as Section 521 of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations, apply to all buildings and facilities in the Commonwealth that are open to members of the public including but not limited to, retail establishments, hotels and motels, multiple dwellings, educational facilities, medical facilities, detention facilities, places of worship, restaurants, and transportation facilities."

This is for assisting in searching through database that compares existing AAB regulation with proposed amendment as well as commenting on if it aligns with ADA or not.
